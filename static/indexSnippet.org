** My new shiny website published "directly" from my personal .org files
 - /So it doesnt interfere with the flow of my thoughts when using Emacs/
 - /All generated from my personal org files/
 - /All I have to do is type something like this:/
#+INCLUDE: ./static/indexSnippet.org src org
/... and type C-c C-e H A and it publishes to the entire "project" with the help of Emacs ox-hugo package/
